# SEIZED
A Retro-inspired shoot 'em up game. Created by Me, Tata, and Dicky.

# Installation 
Currently not for public use, still in development process.

### Instructions for the devs.
1. Please make sure you have installed [SDL.](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
2. Do not use this in IDE Compiler because they can't handle graphics and rendering. (Also saves a lot of headaches)
3. Kindly use my makefile program so that you can compile the program faster.
4. If you don't know what to do next, contact me.
5. I'll be doing *code review*, so, get your knowledge up about how to create pull requests in GitHub.
6. As the person in charge with the program, I suggest you get your knowledge up with the different API that SDL have to offer
7. If you encounter problems, the internet is there to help you, I may not be able to help you with everything. <br>
**Keep Coding for the Win!**
